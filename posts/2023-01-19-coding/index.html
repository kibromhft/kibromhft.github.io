<meta name="description" content="In today's digital age, computer literacy is a basic requirement for most people. Centuries ago, people relied on oral communication to pass on information from one generation to the next. The ability to read and write was a privilege reserved for the elite few because language literacy was not considered an essential skill. Those who were literate were often looked up to and held in high regard. This created a stark division between the literate and the illiterate, with the latter relying on the former for even the most basic communication needs. It wasn't until several centuries later that society began to see the value in literacy for all.">

  "articleBody": "Technology has been a game-changer in many industries, bringing about a variety of benefits for society such as increased efficiency, improved communication, and access to information. However, it has also brought about a significant concern: the replacement of jobs. According to a report published by the World Economic Forum, the use of technology is rapidly replacing jobs at an unprecedented rate (World Economic Forum, 2018). This displacement of jobs is a result of automation and digitization, which have changed the way work is done in many industries. The impact of technology on jobs has led to a number of concerns, such as unemployment, income inequality, and changes in the skills required for different types of work. This blog post will explore the impact of technology on jobs, the concerns it raises, and the potential benefits it can bring. We will examine the effects of automation and digitization on different industries and the ways in which technology is changing the nature of work. Additionally, we will explore potential solutions to mitigate the negative effects of job displacement, such as reskilling and retraining programs. The aim of this blog post is to provide an understanding of the current and future impact of technology on jobs. It also provides insights into how individuals and organizations can adapt to the changing nature of work.\n",

<p class="custom-paragraph" style="text-align: justify;">In today's digital age, computer literacy is a basic requirement for most people. Centuries ago, people relied on oral communication to pass on information from one generation to the next. The ability to read and write was a privilege reserved for the elite few because language literacy was not considered an essential skill. Those who were literate were often looked up to and held in high regard. This created a stark division between the literate and the illiterate, with the latter relying on the former for even the most basic communication needs. It wasn't until several centuries later that society began to see the value in literacy for all.</p>
<p class="custom-paragraph" style="text-align: justify;">The spread of literacy was slow and gradual, with schools and educational institutions being established to teach the masses how to read and write. At first, literacy was only available to the privileged few, but as time went on, more and more people gained access to education. This brought about a significant change in society, as people became more informed and knowledgeable about the world around them. Consequently, more opportunities have emerged, especially with the advent of technology and the internet, making educational resources increasingly accessible to all. This shift has ushered in a new era of opportunities for those who previously lacked access to educational materials, paving the way for a more level playing field for the benefit of all. The democratization of knowledge has facilitated a more connected and equitable global population, breaking down traditional barriers to education and promoting greater social justice.</p>
<p class="custom-paragraph" style="text-align: justify;">This proliferation of education has had far-reaching positive impacts on society, creating a virtuous cycle of innovation, empowering individuals to pursue new career paths and entrepreneurial ventures. While it is true that the proliferation of education has had some positive impacts on society, it has also had negative impacts. This has led to increased competition for jobs, and has resulted in many people being underemployed or unemployed. At the same time, these negative impacts can also be seen as a sign of progress, as they are indicative of a highly educated and competitive workforce that is eager to leverage their skills to be successful.</p>
<p class="custom-paragraph" style="text-align: justify;">However, as technology continues to advance, new skills are needed to thrive in the modern world. One such skill that is rapidly becoming essential is coding artificial intelligence (AI). The ability to code AI has become the new literacy. Just as the ability to read and write human language was once reserved for the elite, this new form of literacy is emerging in the present - the ability to write code is currently limited to a small group of technologists and computer scientists. But someday, we hope, this skill will become as common as reading and writing human language.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="custom-paragraph" style="text-align: justify;">AI is becoming an increasingly integral part of our lives, from autonomous vehicles to virtual assistants and it's showing no signs of slowing down. With the growing importance of AI and its branches&nbsp;in almost every sphere of our lives, from healthcare to finance, transportation to education, it is essential that we invest the time and effort in developing the skills necessary to create intelligent systems that can solve complex problems and improve the quality of our lives. Learning to use technology is similar to learning a new language; while it can seem intimidating at first, with enough practice and immersion it can quickly become second nature. In the same way that becoming fluent in a human language requires understanding of grammar and pronunciation, being able to write code requires understanding of the basics, syntax and structure of the code in order to create a functioning program. <strong><em>But what does it take to become proficient in coding AI, and what skills are required</em></strong>? As the famous American writer Eudora Welty once wrote: &ldquo;Indeed, learning to write may be part of learning to read. For all I know, writing comes out of a superior devotion to reading.&ldquo; I would be happy to write a more technical and detailed blog post on coding AI as a new literacy and explain how learning programming languages, algorithms, data structures, machine learning, and mathematics is essential to coding AI.</p>
